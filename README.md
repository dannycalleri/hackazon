# Hackazon [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dannycalleri/hackazon.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dannycalleri/hackazon)

Hackazon is an experimental e-commerce platform, welcome!

## How to

The project relies on a CI service (Travis) for building and testing, but if you want to run it locally (you should have the latest version of Maven installed), you have to install dependencies first:

`mvn install -DskipTests=true`

and then run

`mvn test -B`
